**Write a short note (not exceeding 2 lines) on the following topics:**

- API  
  - Application Programming Interface (source code that is exposed to be used by outer world. Can be free/paid)
  - Assists a software application to communicate/use the functionalities of the other software application. Example: REST, FAST APIs

- SDK  
  - Software Development Kit (A package of some utilities to be used to call APIs internally.)
  - For example, Microsoft Azure SDK, LangChain SDK for Python.
  
- Web APIs  
  - We Call the APIs by interacting to the website interface. 
  - For example <https://chatgpt.com/> calls the API of ChatGPT and make the user able to send prompts and get the response via http requests.
  
- Library APIs  
  - Make us able to get the APIs called on our local machines and use as per the requirements.
  - For example, we can call the APIs of GPT locally and do fine tune it as required by just passing arguments. Another example is to simply install and import scikit-learn Library, and call its APIs to use the required functionality.
  
- Prompting and Completion
  - Communication to a web interface works on a *request and response* principal.
  - For LLMs, we do prompting as input and get the completion in return.
